# Cost of Living Analysis by Country

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze cost of living and local purchasing power indices across various countries around the world. The goal is to explore economic differences between countries and better understand how these indices relate to each other.

## Overview
The analysis focuses on identifying countries with the highest and lowest cost of living, as well as those with the highest and lowest local purchasing power. Additionally, the relationship between cost of living and purchasing power is explored to provide a comprehensive view of global economic conditions.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before starting the analysis, the dataset underwent several preparation steps:

- **Missing Values Check:** No missing values were found in the dataset.
- **Data Type Exploration:** All data types were reviewed and adjusted as needed.
- **Statistical Summary:** A statistical summary was generated to better understand the data distribution.

## Business Questions Addressed

### 1. **Countries with the Highest and Lowest Cost of Living**
   - **Objective:** Identify the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest cost of living.
   - **Results:** Visualizations were created to highlight these countries, providing a clear understanding of the most and least expensive regions to live in.

### 2. **Purchasing Power vs. Cost of Living**
   - **Objective:** Analyze the relationship between local purchasing power and cost of living.
   - **Results:** A scatter plot was used to visualize this relationship, showing how purchasing power varies with the cost of living across different countries.

### 3. **Countries with the Highest and Lowest Local Purchasing Power**
   - **Objective:** Identify the countries with the highest and lowest local purchasing power.
   - **Results:** The top 3 countries with the highest purchasing power were compared with the bottom 3 countries. The resulting visualization clearly illustrates economic disparities.

## Conclusion (main)
The project provided a detailed analysis of economic conditions in various countries, highlighting both regions with high living costs and those with strong local purchasing power. This information can be useful for economic decisions, public policy, and comparative studies between countries.

## Comparison Between Pakistan, Switzerland, and Brazil
The analysis details the comparison between Pakistan, Switzerland, and Brazil in terms of various economic indices. Comparisons are based on the files `Analyses (Switzerland X Brazil).ipynb`, `Analyses (Pakistan X Brazil).ipynb`, and include:

- **Index Comparison:** Visual comparison of economic indices between Switzerland and Brazil using bar charts and pie charts.
- **Relative Differences:** Calculation of percentage differences between indices of the two countries, highlighting how Swiss values compare to those of Brazil.

### Visualizations and Results
- **Bar Charts:** Display direct comparison of indices between Switzerland and Brazil.
- **Pie Charts:** Show the proportion of indices in each country, facilitating visual comparison.
- **Relative Differences:** A table with percentage differences between the indices of the two countries, providing a clear view of economic disparities.

## Conclusion (Analyses (Switzerland X Brazil) and (Pakistan X Brazil))
The project provided a detailed analysis of economic conditions in Switzerland, Pakistan, and Brazil, highlighting differences in cost of living and local purchasing power indices.

## Methods and Techniques
Several methods and techniques were used to address the business questions:

- **Grouping and Aggregation:** Data was grouped and aggregated to summarize indices by country. This helped identify the countries with the highest and lowest values for each index.

- **Data Visualization:** Bar charts and pie charts were utilized to highlight trends and patterns in the data. Bar charts provided a clear comparison of indices between countries, while pie charts illustrated the proportion of each index.

- **Relative Difference Calculation:** Percentage differences between indices for Switzerland and Brazil were calculated to quantify the disparities.

- **Application of Various Python Libraries:** Utilized `pandas` for data manipulation and `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.
